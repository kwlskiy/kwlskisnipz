Abhay your code looks good! here are a few suggestions
## 1. use let and const instead of var whenever possible
```JS
// here you can use const f.e. due to the fact you will not change recKeys
var recKeys = localStorage.getItem("recordedKeys").split(" ");
// Play each recorded key with timeout of 300
recKeys.forEach((name, i) => {

// so f.e.
const recKeys = localStorage.getItem("recordedKeys").split(" ");
// Play each recorded key with timeout of 300
recKeys.forEach((name, i) => {
```
## 2. avoid unnecessary introduction of variables
```JS
//here you use newVal to get the string that you want to save to the storage, but you could just use it directly where needed
var newVal =
    localStorage.getItem("recordedKeys") +
    key.getAttribute("data-key") +
    " ";
key.classList.add("record");
localStorage.setItem("recordedKeys", newVal);

//what you can do
key.classList.add("record");
localStorage.setItem("recordedKeys", localStorage.getItem("recordedKeys") + key.getAttribute("data-key") + " ");

//this is a really minor point, in JS it can affect performance slightly and is irrelevant most of the time but is really dependant on what the compiler does with your code
//with that said, its a known discussion if one or the other is more readable/adequate
//https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_performance.asp
//so for you it really comes down to just keeping this in mind
```
## 3. avoid unnecessary nesting
```JS
//here is an example where you can spare some nesting and lines by turning it around
if (e.keyCode == 32) {
    // your code...
} else {
    return;
}
//instead of checking wheter the keycode is 32 you can just check if its not and then move on
if (e.keyCode !== 32) 
    return;
// your code...

//in this case it might not be that impactful but if you have a chain of validation, this will keep your code flat and more readable
```
## 4. avoid repetitive work
```JS
//here you play your audio
recAudio.volume = 0.5;
recAudio.play();

//you do this everytime you are pressing a button, so basically you also set the volume everytime
//but that is not needed
//when your document loads you can just set the audio for all your elements

//set audio volume at the start and not when you press a key
for (const el of document.getElementsByTagName("audio")) el.volume = 0.5;

```
## 5. avoid re-referencing dom elements that are static
```JS
//here you get your elements to use
document.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
    const audio = document.querySelector(`audio[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`);
    const key = document.querySelector(`div[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`);
    const keys = document.querySelector(".keys");
    //your code...
});

//now your keys variable will always be the same but you will still get it always
//so what you can do
const keys = document.querySelector(".keys");
document.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
    const audio = document.querySelector(`audio[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`);
    const key = document.querySelector(`div[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`);
    //your code...
});

//we just reuse keys and our code will prob. be faster
```
## 6. overlapping audio elements sound
```JS
//here you have your audio play 
var play = setTimeout(() => {
    const recAudio = document.querySelector(
        `audio[data-key="${name}"]`
    );
    if (recAudio) {
        recAudio.volume = 0.5;
        recAudio.play();
    }
}, i * 300);

//the problem here is that 300ms is not enough to play f.e. the Openhat, and then it wont play the queue that you have recorded correctly
//the main issue here is that you reuse the same audio element and expect it to play even if its not finished

//to overcome this you either reset the current audio time in your timeout callback (so it chops the audio)
recAudio.currentTime = 0;

//or you create a clone of the exact audio element and let it do its own thing
recAudio.cloneNode(true).play();

//or you increase the duration it plays

```
## 7. consider using a JS onload event
right now you put your script at the bottom of the body, this means it depends where its located
if you wrap your js with a listener for when the document is loaded, the location does not matter anymore and you can even put it in the head like your classList
